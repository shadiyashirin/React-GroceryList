# My First React Grocery List App

This is my very first React application, built from the ground up as I learned the fundamentals of React! It's a simple yet functional **Grocery List** manager that allows users to add, delete, search for, and mark items as checked/purchased.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Add Items:** Easily add new grocery items to your list.
* **Delete Items:** Remove items from your list with a click.
* **Toggle Checked Status:** Mark items as "checked" (e.g., purchased) and uncheck them.
* **Search/Filter Items:** Quickly find specific items in your list.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **React:** The core JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web pages.
* **CSS3:** For styling and making the application visually appealing.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For the application's logic.

## üí° What I Learned

Building this application was an incredible learning experience! Here are some key concepts I grasped:

* **Component-Based Architecture:** Understanding how to break down UI into reusable components.
* **State Management:** How to manage and update component-specific data using `useState`.
* **Props:** Passing data between components.
* **Event Handling:** Responding to user interactions (clicks, input changes, etc.).
* **Conditional Rendering:** Displaying different UI elements based on certain conditions.
* **Lists and Keys:** Efficiently rendering lists of items.
* **Basic Hooks:** Getting familiar with `useState` and (potentially) `useEffect`.

This project was primarily a learning exercise for me.
